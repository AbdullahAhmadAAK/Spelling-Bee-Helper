# Guide

## How to Use

1. Type in the words you want to practice one by one OR at once (use Lens or similar app for reading words from photo)
2. Click Save List and memorize
3. Hide the Words when you're ready to practice
4. Play the Words one by one and write down their spelling in your notebook.
5. When you're finished with the words, click Restore List and Show Words to view correct spellings
6. Compare spellings with the ones you've written

## Future Plans/Features

1. User should be able to upload image of spelling list, and the app will extract all words from it (will need backend - later!)
4. User should be able to have many lists to divide his work into segments and store them on his browser.
6. User should get error if word's pronunciation is not found in any API, and the app should not let him add that word.
7. Better responsiveness and more user-friendly UI.
8. Error validation - only accept words with correct spelling. Give error if word not found in dictionary, don't add to list. Give error if words in wordlist input incorrect, format not right.
